// Do not use any top-level diverts. The StoryController will automatically jump to the "start" knot.

// The system will always look for a knot with the name "start" to execute first. Inside of this knot, designers should set the current time of day and location. This will move all characters to where they need to be. Optionally, you can include prologue content under this knot to help introduce the player to the game.
